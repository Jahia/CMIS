Integration of Jahia and OpenCMIS client and server

For the moment only the CMIS atom server is implemented, and only supports browsing nt:file and nt:folder sub-types
The Atom URL is :

http://localhost:8080/cms/cmis/atom/

(don't forget the trailing slash or you will get an exception). Login credentials are valid Jahia credentials. You can
connect using the CMIS workbench available here : http://chemistry.apache.org/java/download.html
